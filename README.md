## Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository consists of course material of a free online course on DSA for placements, available at: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA&si=7OpWtpsEY21m385A

### Methods to figure out which algorithm to use:

Binary Search: if the problem allows you to discard all possibilities lesser than a value when the current value faile, we can say that it follows the pattern of binary search

Selections Sort: Use selection sort only if the size of the data structure is small as it has O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

Bubble sort: the i'th largest element is placed in the correct place in the i'th iteration
